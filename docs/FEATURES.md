## Reports

### Worklog Report
Worklog report module lets you view the daily worklog details for you and your team members in different formats.

### Sprint Report
This report lets you view the sprint based report including worklog for sprint and velocity chart when more than one sprint is selected. You can export it to excel once generated.

### Custom Report
If you want a custom report with simple features and build quickly, then you can use this report to generate it using JQL. This is a very simple report which enables you to quickly generate it and save it for further use. Once saved this can be used as a custom gadget as well in dashboard and can be shared with other users by exporting it.

### Advanced report builder
At times you will have to build a report which needs lots of customization which cannot be achieved using Custom report. That is where you will have to make use of Advanced report builder. You can build your own report by adding required parameters, dataset from various sources, drag and drop UI components like tables, chart, images, etc., apply custom styles, add expressions and custom functions to format your fields. This report once saved, can be used as custom gadgets in dashboard and can be shared with other users by exporting it from Saved Query gadget. This report builder would be suitable for technical users who can use their technical skills to build their own report the way they need it.

### Share reports
You can share your custom report or report built using Advanced report builder with other users. If you would like to share the report with your colleagues, you can export it and share the file with them after which they can import and use it. If you would like to share it with all users of Jira Assist, then you can contact me through mail or raise a ticket along with the exported report file. I will review it and post it for other users to download. Also any users can raise a ticket with their request for customizations in shared reports or a whole new report. Any one interested to contribute can fulfill these requests by building it and uploading the working report.
